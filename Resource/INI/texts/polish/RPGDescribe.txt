Intellect and Leadership are necessary for this trait(T*0.8+A*0.2)
}

Accuracy
{
Accuracy. One of the most important skills for those sailing the high seas. A decent captain will not waste gunpowder and cannonballs just to scatter the fish: every salvo will hit the mark! And once the salty wind disperses smoke over the captain's bridge, there shall be no enemy ships left on the horizon! 
Requires perception and a portion luck. (I*0.8+S*0.2)
}

Cannons
{
Cannons. Load the cannon quickly, roll it up and while the echo of the salvo is still roaring between the bulkheads, clear, load, aim, pour water on the cannon so it doesn't overheat... In the heat of battle there should be nothing excessive: load, roll up, fire! 
Requires talent and strength. (T*0.6+P*0.4)
}

Sailing
{
Navigation. The ability to bring the ship safely to the port through storm and fog; the skill of using navigation equipment and controlling the squadrons. The largest and most terrifying ship will fly like a bird, obeying the steady hand of an experienced skipper.

}

Repair
{
Repair. When the enemy storms your ship with a volley of cannonballs, splintering the sides and turning sails into sives; when the hull is cracking in the storm, and wind tears the rigging apart thread by thread, the repair becomes one of the most important naval skills. 
Endurance matters a lot here, but perception is crucial, too. (E*0.8+I*0.2)
}

Grappling
{
Boarding. Aligning a ship with the enemy vessel, flinging the hooks to board the trembling enemy, sweeping the decks and taking the ship as well-deserved prise - this requires great agility and experience, but the loot will surely make up for all the effort. 
Reaction and talent are needed there. (R*0.7+T*0.3)
}

Defence
{
Defense. Day after day, the crew slowly becomes one with the ship. A seasoned sailor is worth a dozen sprouts from a local tavern. Every good captain must protect his men and not allow them to perish foolishly. 
Endurance and leadership are very important in ensuring the crew's survival in battle. (E*0.5+A*0.5)
}

Sneak
{
Stealth. To pass undetected past the enemy, to escape when being chased in the open ocean, or instantly appear out of thin air to attack an unsuspecting enemy - every captain must possess the proper skill of stealth. 
It would not be possible without a share of both good luck and perception. (S*0.5+I*0.5)
}

Loyality
{
Your actions affect the officers' loyalty. White knights will refuse to be employed by a scoundrel, and natural bandits won't remain honest for too long.
~
A high level of Authority can significally reduce the impact that decisions have on the drop of your officers' loyalty, in case those actions disagree with their worldview.
}

Authority
{
Authority, Fame and Honor distinguish the protagonist
from all other game characters.
~
Authority is an assessment of the hero by his surroundings (first of all, the crew of the ships in the squadron of the protagonist). If authority of the captain fell critically, he is presented with a black mark and offered to resign voluntarily or forcibly. If Authority is high, the crew shall rally around the commander amd withstand any trials with good faith in their leader!
~
Honor grows when the hero saves the world and its inhabitants. Or falls to the most ugly depths, from broken promises, perpetrated violence and villainy. Honor depends on the character’s actions and, in turn, influences how other people in the game perceive him.
~
However, if the hero lives a monotonous and measured way of life, chooses the least risky solutions, travels alone in the empty seas, his Honor and Fame fall like sand through an open palm, sinking to a neutral and uncomplicated medium. In the game, the memory of the community is short and does not exceed for a half of the in-game year.
}

Attention_abilities
{
Attention!
Some abilities may not be available for
certain types of protagonists or officers.
}

Personal_abilities
{
Abilities expanding the capabilities of your character.
}

Ship_abilities
{
Abilities affecting the effectiveness of controlling a ship.
Can be inherited by the protagonist from the officers who know their business and are assigned to the best positions on the ship according to their skill.
}

Abilities_available
{
The number indicates the amount of unallocated ability points.
}

Abilities_active
{
The number indicates the abilities a character has activated.
}

Rank
{
The rank indicates the level of progress of the character in the game. It increases with the hero's experience. As the rank of the hero increases, his Life also increases by a number based on the Endurance value.
~
As the rank of the hero increases, he will meet stronger adversaries and find better items more often.
}

Life
{
Life is a parameter, determining the ability of the character's body to take a certain amount of physical punishment. The greater the character's life, the more slashing, piercing and bullet wounds one can take before death.
~
As the rank of the hero increases, his Life also increases, based on Endurance.
}

Health
{
Health is the indicator of the physical state of the hero. The lower the health, the lower are the attributes of the hero in the game. Health drops when the hero gets severely wounded in a short period of time, and it recovers, if the hero avoids combat to let the wounds heal properly.
}

Energy
{
Energy is a parameter determining the hero's stamina in melee combat. All attack actions require energy. In other words, a character gets tired in battle and needs rest to replenish his stamina.
~
Maximum energy is determined by the current value of the character's reaction.
}

Money
{
Money is the king of all men. Piastres, talers, guineas… What's the difference, if it's all liquid cash!
}

Reputation
{
Reputation is the measure of other characters' attitude towards you. Reputation can be high (positive), neutral and low (negative). Reputation changes according to the hero's deeds and determines how other characters in the game perceive your hero.
~
The fame of the hero fades with time, his achievements or failures being erased from people's memories. Evil deeds are not as easily forgotten as good ones. If a hero doesn't take any sides or perform any significant actions, his reputation will eventually become 'unknown adventurer'.
}

Weight
{
The maximum weight a character can carry without losing movement speed and getting other penalties to his skills.
Depends on strength and endurance.
}

Title
{
The title indicates how useful the character is for the state he is serving.
}

NextExp
{
Experience threshold indicates how many points are assigned to the current skill, rank and ability, and how much experience is needed to gain another point.
~
Skills are developing when you're performing the corresponding actions. For example, for each accurate pistol shot you will gain experience points for the 'Firearms' skill. These skill points are counted towards rank experience and personal/ship abilities (depends on skill type).
~
By crossing the rank experience threshold the hero will gain a new rank, and with it - more life and ability points, which the player may assign as he or she chooses.
}

TABLE_PERKS {Hero abilities}

TABLE_PERKS_desc
{

~
Double-click on the selected ability to read its description and learn about the pre-requisites (if there are any)

}

In "Nation" window you can see the current flag of your ship - you can change it only at sea, to hide your true identity. Note that ships in the open sea and guards at the port might see through your disguise. Stealth of the hero affects the chance that the disguise is successful. If a hero has a bounty placed on his head by his nation, he is considered an enemy of his own nation as well.
~
Enemy recognition is performed with consideration of the official relations between states, as well as the bounties they place on your head.
~
Teleportation doesn't work in enemy cities.
}

Drunk_hint
{
Alcohol affects your skills. If you're drunk, you will not feel much pain, but won't be able to perform delicate tasks, either.
}

England_descr
{
England. Britannia still has another century to truly 'rule the waves', but if there is a rising naval power to contend with the might of Spain - it's England. While France attacks Spanish power in Europe, English privateers and naval patrols feast on unprotected Spanish shipping on their way to ultimately dominating the Caribbean.
}

France_descr
{
The disastrous wars of religion between Catholic and Huguenot that have plagued France since the beginning of the Reformation over a hundred years ago have largely passed with the ascension of the fifteen-year-old Louis XIV de Bourbon to the throne. Still a far cry from the future 'Sun King' that will lead France to a Golden Age, King Louis wishes to continue in the traditions of the great Cardinal Richelieu to strengthen the apparatus of state through vigorous reform. There is much conflict still in Europe, but looming largest in the eyes of King Louis are the bitter rivals of the Bourbons, the Habsburgs - currently ruling as king of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor. To compete with the Spanish both near and abroad, King Louis has ordered Jean-Baptiste Colbert to revitalize the French Navy. A new and efficient tax regime allows France not only to pay off its debts from nearly fifty years of war, but also to allocate funds for naval and army reforms. While the French Army is still not quite as modern or battle hardened as Oliver Cromwell's English New Model Army, they are rapidly becoming one of the best equipped and trained on the continent in the new linear style of war. New ships of the latest designs are being built at Toulon and Saint-Nazaire, and modern cannons being cast at factories in the interior.
~
Unlike the English, France's main concerns lie on the European continent, and colonial concerns often fall secondary to the more pressing need for defending the French border against the Habsburgs in Austria, Italy, and Spain.
~
Due to this neglect, the French Company of the Americas made the decision to sell part of their colonial holdings on the Caribbean Antilles to the Knights of Malta, through a deal orchestrated by French chevalier and Governor-General Philippe de Poincy. De Poincy and the Order Grandmaster Jean de Lascaris-Castellar hope through this purchase to make up  for the revenue of the Order lost chasing Barbary corsairs around the Mediterranean through more...creative methods frowned upon by the Holy See. A promising young knight of the Order named Michel de Monper even proposes to privateer against Spanish shipping!
~
And so it falls to the cream of French nobility to hitch a ride on the next boat to the Caribbean colonies, hoping to find fame, fortune, adventure, and perhaps expand the French Empire while at it.
~
}

Holland_descr
{
Holland. The United Provinces of the Netherlands is a young nation, recently free of an eighty year independence war against Spain. The Dutch are a thrifty and hardworking people with a craving for trade superiority. Currently the Dutch quietly aids France in their struggle against their common enemy - Spain; but in all, seeks to be a neutral power that can trade with (or cheat) any customer!
}

Spain_descr
{
Spain. A great but waning colonial power. Currently holding the greater part of the Caribbean islands and the Spanish Main, Spain finds itself under constant pressure from England and France, who are seeking to claim the endless riches of the New World for themselves.
}

Pirate_descr
{
Pirates. These men sail against all flags and live by the Pirate Code (although they're more like guidelines) of the Brethren of the Coast. This doesn't hinder them while selling their loot in English or French colonies such as Port Royal and Tortuga where the governor turns a blind eye. Depending on the situation, pirates might fight 'legitimately' for any of the powers who can give them a letter of marque, but ultimately their prize is the same as English and French privateers - a nice fat Spanish treasure ship.
~
For any naval patrol, the sight of a pirate flag on the horizon is like throwing bacon to a starving wolf. For the vast majority of pirates, there are only two ends - the gibbet or the hangman's noose.
}

Hunter_hint
{
The attitude of a nation, its citizens and soldiers to you. Good deeds for the country increase your reputation; bad ones may even lead to a bounty placed on the hero's head. That means continuous pursuit both on land and at sea.
~
The price on your head can be reduced by good deeds in favor of the specific country, or even bribery. With enough effort, a neutral relationship can be restored.
}

LevelComplexity {Difficulty}

LevelComplexity_desc
{
This parameter affects the rate of hero's experience gain, progression rate, enemy strength, income, and many other factors.
~
Difficulty level varies from 'Easy' to 'Impossible'.
}

RechargePistolOnLine {Pistol recharging}

RechargePistolOnLine_desc
{
In this mode, pistols can't be reloaded in combat; only when the sword is sheathed.
~
This mode affects all characters in the game.
}

HardcoreGame {HardcoreGame}

HardcoreGame_desc
{
Not enough adrenaline? You wanna feel like a true corsair and realize the full effect of all your deeds on the world around you? In this mode, saving the game is only possible on sacred ground - in church. You will have to do everything right the first time, without the chance to reload a saved game over and over again. There is no room for error.
}

ArcadeSailMode_desc
{
Speed and dynamics of naval combat. Quick maneuvering, high speeds, and quick cannon reloading - requires a great deal of consideration for your next tactical move.
}

EncountersRate_desc
{
Frequency of game events, especially the number of ships on the world map.
}

WorldAlivePause {Nation quests}

WorldAlivePause_desc
{
This mode allows you to go through one of the scenario quest lines for the Nations, but before it ends, the game’s “living world” stops the governor-general moves from town to town, cities seizing by other nations, and blocks the opportunity to capture the city to the hero.
~
The living world will work only after the completion of the scenario history.
}

Prisoner {Prisoner}

Prisoner_desc
{
A prisoner is a character who is captured and held on your ship against his will. Any prisoner can be interrogated in the hold of your ship. Most of the time, you can get a ransom for him, and if it's a pirate, recruit him into the crew of the hero. You can imprison the passenger whom you have taken to deliver, when he begins to resent because of the long trip while delivering to his destination. Captains are those who surrender to you during boarding or raised by you while their being on boat at the open sea. The largest amount of the ransom is given by the governor of the same nation as the prisoner, but it fluctuates, as does the opinion of the governors themselves about the value of the prisoner.
Captive captains can appeal to your hero with various requests. Do not avoid communicating with prisoners: it may bring an unexpected benefit.
}

shipChoose_hint
{
Double-click with the mouse (or press the 'Enter' key) on the image of the companion's ship to begin an exchange when out of battle.
~
You can start an exchange by sailing close to a companion ship and pressing the quick command 'Exchange'.
Can be done in or out of combat.
}

GoodsCargo_hint
{
Cargo on board of the ship: ammunition, goods and implements in the hold.
~
To see the items that do not fit in the allotted window, use the slider on the right side of the list.
~
Press the 'Enter' key or double-click on the item in the list to view the description of the product, toss an unwanted amount overboard, or drop a mine.
}

EXP_SLIDE {Experience gain rate}

EXP_SLIDE_desc
{
This setting adjusts the rate, at which the main character and his officers gain experience. The greater the rate, the faster will they acquire new skill points, new levels and abilities.
}

Partition_hint
{
Shares of the crew must be paid no later than on the 1st of every month. The following payments are made:
~
Monthly upkeep - combined wages of the sailors and officers, compensation for the injured, and upkeep for the ship and equipment.
~
Loot share - splitting the looted valuables and distributing shares of them between the members of a crew.
~
All captured ships and goods are subject to sharing. According to the laws of the Brethren of the Coast, the share of a deceased sailor or officer goes to their relatives and friends.
~
The shares for the crew members are as follows:
- sailor - 1 share
- officer - 10 shares
- companion - 30 shares
- captain - 200-650 shares
In addition, the captain, as the owner of the ships of his squadron, additionally receives 20-120 shares from each ship (depending on class of the vessel), and he also bears all costs associated with the maintenance and possible loss of ships.
If a captain has a patent, 10% of the loot is paid to the Nation's treasury.
~
Delaying the payment for the current month will cause unrest in the crew until the end of the month, whereas payment in advance will increase their morale.
~
Delaying a payment for the past month will significantly reduce the morale of the crew and the loyalty of your officers and companions.
~
}

}

{

}

CasualMode_desc
{
Classic mode is suitable for players who want to focus on the main character's story. It is a little more difficult than exploration mode and requires more attention and effort, but allows you to fully immerse yourself in the atmosphere created by the authors of the game.
~
This mode is great for new players and for those who value free play above all. Quest deadlines are either disabled or increased. Time runs slower on the global map - depending on the chosen difficulty setting. Player's ship get a 5% speed bonus on the global map too.
